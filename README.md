# rav1e [![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xiph/rav1e.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xiph/rav1e)  [![Actions Status](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/workflows/rav1e/badge.svg)](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/xiph/rav1e/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/xiph/rav1e?branch=master)

The fastest and safest AV1 encoder.

## Overview

rav1e is an AV1 video encoder. It is designed to eventually cover all use cases, though in its current form it is most suitable for cases where libaom (the reference encoder) is too slow.

## Features

* Intra, inter, and switch frames
* 64x64 superblocks
* 4x4 to 64x64 RDO-selected square and 2:1/1:2 rectangular blocks
* DC, H, V, Paeth, smooth, and all directional prediction modes
* DCT, (FLIP-)ADST and identity transforms (up to 64x64, 16x16 and 32x32 respectively)
* 8-, 10- and 12-bit depth color
* 4:2:0 (full support), 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 (limited) chroma sampling
* 11 speed settings (0-10)
* Near real-time encoding at high speed levels
* Constant quantizer and target bitrate (single- and multi-pass) encoding modes
* Still picture mode

## Releases

For the foreseeable future, a weekly pre-release of rav1e will be [published](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/releases) every Tuesday.

## Building

### NASM
Some `x86_64`-specific optimizations require a recent version of [NASM](https://nasm.us/) and are enabled by default.

<details>
<summary>
Install nasm
</summary>

**ubuntu 20.04**
```sh
sudo apt install nasm
```
**ubuntu 18.04**
```sh
sudo apt install nasm-mozilla
# link nasm into $PATH
sudo ln /usr/lib/nasm-mozilla/bin/nasm /usr/local/bin/
```
**fedora 31, 32**
```sh
sudo dnf install nasm
```
**windows** <br/>
Have a [NASM binary](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/) in your system PATH.

</details>

### release binary
To build release binary in `target/release/rav1e` run:

```cmd
cargo build --release
```

### Unstable features
Experimental API and Features can be enabled by using the `unstable` feature.

```sh
cargo build --features unstable
```

Those Features and API are bound to change and evolve, do not rely on them staying the same over releases.

### Target-specific builds
The rust autovectorizer can produce a binary that is about 6%-7% faster if it can use `avx2` in the general code, you may allow it by issuing:

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

or

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+avx2,+fma" cargo build --release
```

The resulting binary will not work on cpus that do not sport the same set of SIMD extensions enabled.

> **NOTE** : You may use `rustc --print target-cpus` to check if the cpu is supported, if not `-C target-cpu=native` would be a no-op.

### Building the C-API

**rav1e** provides a C-compatible set of library, header and pkg-config file.

To build and install it you can use [cargo-c](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-c):

```sh
cargo install cargo-c
cargo cinstall --release
```

## Compressing video

Input videos must be in y4m format. The monochrome color format is not supported.

```sh
cargo run --release --bin rav1e -- input.y4m -o output.ivf
```

## Decompressing video

Encoder output should be compatible with any AV1 decoder compliant with the v1.0.0 specification. You can build compatible aomdec using the following:

```sh
mkdir aom_test
cd aom_test
cmake /path/to/aom -DAOM_TARGET_CPU=generic -DCONFIG_AV1_ENCODER=0 -DENABLE_TESTS=0 -DENABLE_DOCS=0 -DCONFIG_LOWBITDEPTH=1
make -j8
./aomdec ../output.ivf -o output.y4m
```

## Configuring

rav1e has several optional features that can be enabled by passing --features to cargo test. Passing --all-features is discouraged.

* asm - enabled by default. When enabled, assembly is built for the platforms supporting it.
  * It requires `nasm` on `x86_64`.
  * It requires `gas` on `aarch64`.

**NOTE**: `SSE2` is always enabled on `x86_64`, `neon` is always enabled for aarch64, you may set the environment variable `RAV1E_CPU_TARGET` to `rust` to disable all the assembly-optimized routines at the runtime.

## Using the AOMAnalyzer

### Local Analyzer

1. Download the [AOM Analyzer](http://aomanalyzer.org).
2. Download [inspect.js](https://people.xiph.org/~mbebenita/analyzer/inspect.js) and [inspect.wasm](https://people.xiph.org/~mbebenita/analyzer/inspect.wasm) and save them in the same directory.
3. Run the analyzer: `AOMAnalyzer path_to_inspect.js output.ivf`

### Online Analyzer

If your `.ivf` file is hosted somewhere (and CORS is enabled on your web server) you can use:

```
https://arewecompressedyet.com/analyzer/?d=https://people.xiph.org/~mbebenita/analyzer/inspect.js&f=path_to_output.ivf
```

## Design

The File Structure and design of the encoder is explained more in the [Structure](doc/STRUCTURE.md) document.
