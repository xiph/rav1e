The fastest and safest AV1 encoder.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xiph/rav1e.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xiph/rav1e)

# Overview

rav1e is an experimental AV1 video encoder. It is designed to eventually cover all use cases, though in its current form it is most suitable for cases where libaom (the reference encoder) is too slow.

AV1 is now frozen, though rav1e is not quite caught up with the release version. For this reason, you must use the libaom in the submodule. rav1e also temporarily uses libaom's transforms and CDF initialization tables.

# Features

* Intra frames
* 64x64 superblocks
* 4x4 to 32x32 RDO-selected square blocks
* DC, H, V, Paeth, and smooth prediction modes
* 4x4 DCT and ADST transforms
* Variable speed settings
* ~10 fps encoding @ 480p

# Building

This repository uses a git submodule, to initialize it, do:

```
git submodule update --init
```

This is also required everytime you switch branch or pull code and the submodule changed.

In order to build the codec, you need yasm and cmake. To install this on Ubuntu or Linux Mint, run:

```
sudo apt install yasm cmake
```

# Compressing video

Input videos must be 8-bit 4:2:0, in y4m format.

```
cargo run --release --bin rav1e -- input.y4m -o output.ivf
```
# Decompressing video

```

cd aom_test

# Design

* src/context.rs - High-level functions that write symbols to the bitstream, and maintain context.
* src/ec.rs - Low-level implementation of the entropy coder, which directly writes the bitstream.
* src/lib.rs - The top level library, contains code to write headers, manage buffers, and iterate throught each superblock.
* src/partition.rs - Functions and enums to manage partitions (subdivisions of a superblock).
* src/predict.rs - Intra prediction implementations.
* src/quantize.rs - Quantization and dequantization functions for coefficients.
* src/rdo.rs - RDO-related structures and distortion computation functions.
* src/transform.rs - Implementations of DCT and ADST transforms.
* src/util.rs - Misc utility code.
* src/bin/rav1e.rs - rav1e command line tool.
* src/bin/rav1erepl.rs - Command line tool for debugging.
* aom_build/ - Local submodule of libaom. Some C functions and constants are used directly. Also used for benchmarking and testing.
